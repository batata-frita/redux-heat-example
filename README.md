# redux-heat example

On-going development of a practical example of using [redux-heat](https://github.com/batata-frita/redux-heat).

## TODO

The idea is to build a chat application using Firebase as the backend.

- Login page with a submit button;
- Routing (with at least two pages);
- Possibility of sending messages in sequence (queue);
- Search feature (throttle).
